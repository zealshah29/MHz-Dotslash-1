**Project**: Youtube video note-taking extension.

**Problem Statement**: In today's world, most of the students are dependent on YouTube videos for their study and research work. They need a platform through which they can easily take notes capture important screenshots from the ongoing video, and organize them in one place for future reference.

**Solution**: We have built a note-taking Chrome extension that provides the following features:
 1. Capture a Screenshot of the video and directly add it to notes with one click. This way students will no longer have to take a long road of taking screenshots, saving them in some folder, and then later on adding to note/ doc applications. Just click on the screenshot button.
 2. Add ordered/ unordered list and checkbox. List-making is the most common way people use to  make notes quickly and in an organized way. Hence apart from adding simple text, we have also provided some additional functionalities of adding bulletin points, numbered lists, and checkboxes for the same.
 3. Speech-to-text converter. Are you too lazy to type? Speak and add your notes.
 4. Organised Folders to save our notes. Students can create organized folders in our extension and save their notes in it. They can also save the pdf of the notes on their computer system if they wish to.

**Future goals and planning**: To make online study smoother, in the future, we want to extend our Chrome extension to blog sites as well, where students can highlight the important points, mark the doubtful points, add additional notes/ annotations on the website, and save the changes in our organized folder or download the pdf, just as they would do on any physical textbook.
